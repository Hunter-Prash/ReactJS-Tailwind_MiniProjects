FUCKIN USE JWT validation When support agent will view his own ticket queue





Achievements so far:-



1. Created the entire fetching SQL and Dynamodb pipeline to ensure a loosely coupled architecture
   
2. Register, login, and logout functionalities integrated with backend APIs.Token-based (JWT) session handling for secure state persistence.
   
3. S3 Data Ingestion Pipeline

* Implemented a fully automated S3-based ticket ingestion pipeline:
* Supports cold starts (first-time setup) and incremental updates (new files only).
* Dynamically detects and processes only newly uploaded tickets based on S3 LastModified timestamps.
* Maintains checkpoint tracking using a local JSON file for precise state recovery
* Designed it to handle large ticket volumes gracefully with batched reads and error isolation.



4\. Created an NLP function which gives intelligent prompt to the Gemini

Step 2: Basic analytics dashboard (Medium)



Goal: Visualize ticket data like priorities, status, trends.



Backend:



Optionally create a route: GET /tickets/analytics?user=<email>



Aggregate data from DynamoDB: counts by priority, status, etc.



Frontend:



Use React + Recharts (or Chart.js) to display graphs:



Pie chart for priority distribution.



Bar chart for status counts.



Line chart for ticket trends over time.



✅ Outcome: Users can see analytics for their tickets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Step 3: View detailed ticket (Easy-Medium)



Goal: User clicks a ticket and sees details.



Backend:



Route: GET /tickets/:id?user=<email>



Return full ticket details (summary, classification, metadata).



Frontend:



On click, fetch ticket details and display in a modal or new page.



✅ Outcome: Users can drill down into any ticket.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



Step 4: Global message box (Medium)



Goal: Let users post messages visible globally.



Backend:



Create a POST /messages route (save messages in DynamoDB or another table).



Create a GET /messages route to fetch messages.



Frontend:



Create a global message box UI (like ServiceNow).



Display messages in reverse chronological order.



Allow posting new messages via API.



✅ Outcome: Users can communicate via a global message box.

--------------------------------------------------------------------



Step 5: Assign tickets to other users (Medium-Complex)



Goal: Allow users to push tickets into another user’s queue.



Backend:



Route: POST /tickets/:id/assign



Update userQueue for that ticket in DynamoDB.



Frontend:



Add “Assign to user” dropdown on ticket detail or list.



Call API to reassign ticket.



Optionally, show success/failure messages.



✅ Outcome: Tickets can be reassigned to other agents.
