FUCKIN USE JWT validation When support agent will view his own ticket queue


Step 2: Basic analytics dashboard (Medium)

Goal: Visualize ticket data like priorities, status, trends.

Backend:

Optionally create a route: GET /tickets/analytics?user=<email>

Aggregate data from DynamoDB: counts by priority, status, etc.

Frontend:

Use React + Recharts (or Chart.js) to display graphs:

Pie chart for priority distribution.

Bar chart for status counts.

Line chart for ticket trends over time.

✅ Outcome: Users can see analytics for their tickets.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: View detailed ticket (Easy-Medium)

Goal: User clicks a ticket and sees details.

Backend:

Route: GET /tickets/:id?user=<email>

Return full ticket details (summary, classification, metadata).

Frontend:

On click, fetch ticket details and display in a modal or new page.

✅ Outcome: Users can drill down into any ticket.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Global message box (Medium)

Goal: Let users post messages visible globally.

Backend:

Create a POST /messages route (save messages in DynamoDB or another table).

Create a GET /messages route to fetch messages.

Frontend:

Create a global message box UI (like ServiceNow).

Display messages in reverse chronological order.

Allow posting new messages via API.

✅ Outcome: Users can communicate via a global message box.

Step 5: Assign tickets to other users (Medium-Complex)

Goal: Allow users to push tickets into another user’s queue.

Backend:

Route: POST /tickets/:id/assign

Update userQueue for that ticket in DynamoDB.

Frontend:

Add “Assign to user” dropdown on ticket detail or list.

Call API to reassign ticket.

Optionally, show success/failure messages.

✅ Outcome: Tickets can be reassigned to other agents.

Step 6: Real-time updates (Complex)

Goal: Show new tickets in the dashboard as they arrive.

Backend:

Use WebSockets (or something like Socket.IO) to push updates when tickets are added to DynamoDB.

Whenever a ticket is processed and inserted, emit an event to all connected clients.

Frontend:

Connect to the WebSocket server.

Update the dashboard dynamically when new tickets arrive.

✅ Outcome: Users see tickets in real-time without refreshing.
